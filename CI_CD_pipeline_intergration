## 🛠 Step-by-Step CI/CD Setup Guide
1. Link your Project to Vercel
Before the pipeline can work, your local computer and GitHub need to know which Vercel project they are talking to.

Open your terminal in your project root.

    Run: npx vercel link

Log in if prompted, then select your Vercel project.

This creates a folder named .vercel/.

    Open .vercel/project.json and copy these two values:

    - orgId (This is your Team/User ID)

    - projectId (This is your specific Project ID)

2. Generate a Vercel Access Token
GitHub needs a "key" to enter your Vercel account.

    Go to your Vercel Account Settings > Tokens.

    Click Create.

    Name it GitHub-Action-Token and set the scope to your account/team.

    Copy the Token immediately (it will disappear forever once you close the page).

3. Save Secrets in GitHub
    Now, give these values to GitHub so the pipeline can use them securely.

    Go to your repository on GitHub.

    Click Settings (top tab) → Secrets and variables → Actions.

    Click New repository secret and add these three:

        Name: VERCEL_TOKEN | Value: (The token from Step 2)

        Name: VERCEL_ORG_ID | Value: (The orgId from Step 1)

        Name: VERCEL_PROJECT_ID | Value: (The projectId from Step 1)

4. Create the Pipeline File
    GitHub looks for "instructions" in a very specific folder.

    In your project, create the folder: .github/workflows/

    Create a file inside named: main_pipeline.yml

    Paste the configuration code we discussed (the one containing vercel build and vercel deploy).

5. Final Code Check (The "CI" part)
        Next.js is strict during production builds. To ensure your pipeline doesn't fail immediately:

        Fix Lint Errors: Run npm run lint locally and fix any "unescaped entities" or "dependency" errors.

        Fix Build Errors: Run npm run build locally. If you see the "ReferenceError," add export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; to the top of the failing page.

6. Push to Activate
    git add .

    git commit -m "Setup CI/CD pipeline"

    git push origin main

    Go to the Actions tab on GitHub to watch the "assembly line" run!
